Inflation has been caused by Govts irresponsibly printing huge amounts of money. 40 per cent of all money that's ever existed created 2020-2022. Not Ukraine. THIS has caused inflation. Now 2 choices. 1. Raise interest rates and we pay through mortgage costs. 2. Let inflation go unchecked and we pay through high costs exceeding wages. But make no mistake. We pay.

We need and value our nurses! If anyone should leave their employment, it's this unhealthy, arrogant oaf!","Wait.... so 2x people on c.50k each - decent jobs by all accounts, probably skilled trade or degree-educated - who could afford mortgage c.400k (not particularly a mansion) should have selected a house on the local ex-council estate for 200k instead?

He outvoted his Monetary Policy Committee 5:4 several times and artificially suppressed sufficient rates increases against the advice of external members.

My bet is Hunt will be have to be sacked on November 3 when gilts and pound crash by a half after BoE decision to raise the rates below 6%.

This will also have a huge impact on people who rent from private landlords who are on interest only mortgages. The Government could take back control of the Monetary Policy Committee and freeze interest rates for at least two years or bring in mortgage interest relief to subsidise the Bank of England's decisions to deal with inflation.

14,Forum,Anonymous,2023,1,NewsForums,DiscussionForums,Richie. Covid is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses make up around a quarter of the common cold family of viruses. Omicron is a variant of covid which is a milder version of covid which infects the UPPER respiratory system. Instead of the lower respiratory system like earlier variants of covid did. Colds infect the upper respiratory system exactly the same as omicron does. So in conclusion we can safely deduce that omicron is a cold.

This policy has made anyone with money unable to get a return without taking risk, many people have bought property to get some kind of return and that has created the daft increases we've seen in property values. That in turn has made it harder for people to get onto the ladder and those that do need to borrow so much more than they would have had interest rates not been so high to fuel the investment home demand.
