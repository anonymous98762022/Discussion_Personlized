No it's in History. Uh? I was stunned. But maybe the Wikipedia entry doesn't do justice to his education in economics which maybe he has acquired by other means. So let's depersonalise this. MPs, civil servants and leaders of public bodies in addition to being a fit and proper person, should have the appropriate robust education, skills and experience to do the job, just as this is required for jobs in other organisations.",0.080044031

We didn't wear masks as we were exempt, used hand gel which we still do as its a healthy thing to do. None of us have had Covid, no-one we know has had Covid, although 2 have been diagnosed as stage 3 and 4 bowel and breast cancer due to the delays in lockdown. It's time we saw this as something we need to live with along with many other viruses and give priority to those illnesses really needing urgent treatment.If I did contract Covid at 69, I would self isolate and let nature take her course good or bad instead of taking a place in a NHS hospital blocking those in real need. In reality more people survive after having Covid than die but many in excruciating pain die due to other factors, denied treatment.If they are really worried open the Nightingale Hospitals keeping hospitals for the care and treatment of severe illnesses not Covid. Years ago TB isolation hospitals existed why not bring this type of hospital back?","Bailey and the previous fool have kept interest rates too low for too long. This policy has made anyone with money unable to get a return without taking risk, many people have bought property to get some kind of return and that has created the daft increases we've seen in property values. That in turn has made it harder for people to get onto the ladder and those that do need to borrow so much more than they would have had interest rates not been so high to fuel the investment home demand. Now we're in a situation where people have relied upon higher multiples of income to borrow to buy a home based on sustained low rates, none of this would have happened has d the BoE kept rates at 3-5 percent in the 1st place. Home ownership has dropped from 50% to 30% since the 90s",0.192964494
99,Forum,Anonymous,2023,1,NewsForums,DiscussionForums,The figures are BS. There are so many more cases as noone is counting. If you buy a test from Boots you can't register it on the government website. Doctors now don't give a hoot. My doctor sent me a text with a number to call to see if I qualified for meds. They couldn't help because he hadn't registered me with their service. Temp of 38.5 and 2 weeks in bed. The service is terrible. 5 jabs and still caught it.,"House price crash, recession and bank bailout here we come..... We could always just fix energy prices with a bigger windfall tax and then go hell for leather insulating homes and increasing nuclear and renewables. Although that actually involves doing something practical rather than just dumping borrowed money into the pockets of rich Tories !",0.04122819
